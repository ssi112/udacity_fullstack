- API Endpoints
- Styling and Message Flashing


#### Restaurant Layout

URL Routing | Method | Message
---- | ----------- | ------------
/ <br>/restaurants | showRestaurants()  | This page will show all restaurants
/restaurantnew | newRestaurant() | This page will enable user to add new restaurant
/restaurant/restaurant_id/edit | editRestaurant()  | Enable user to edit restaurant name

**Top-Down versus Bottom-Up** \* Algorithm Design

Basis for comparison | Top-down Approach | Bottom-up Approach
--------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------
Basic | Breaks the massive problem into smaller subproblems. | Solves the fundamental low-level problem and integrates them into a larger one.
Process | Submodules are solitarily anaylsed | Examine what data is to be encapsulated, and implies the concept of information hiding.
Communication | Not required in top-down approach | Needs a specific amount of communication
Redundancy | Contain redundant info | Redundancy can be eliminated
Programming Languages | Structure/procedural oriented programming languages (i.e. C) follows the top-down approach | Object-oriented programming languages (like C++, Java, etc.) follows the bottom-up approach.
Mainly Used In | Module documentation, test case creation, code implementation and debugging | Testing
